## System Requirements

- Windows computer
- WampServer with Apache, PHP, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin
- A modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or Firefox

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Install and Start WampServer

Install WampServer and start it. Wait until the WampServer icon becomes green, indicating that Apache and MySQL are running.

### 2. Copy the Project Folder

Copy the complete `The_Yeast_Lab` folder into:

```text
C:\wamp64\www\
```

The resulting path should be:

```text
C:\wamp64\www\The_Yeast_Lab\
```

### 3. Create and Import the Database

1. Open a browser and visit `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`.
2. Select the **Import** tab.
3. Choose `database.sql` from the project folder.
4. Click **Go**.
5. Confirm that the `yeast_lab_db` database is created.
6. Confirm that it contains these tables:
   - `categories`
   - `products`
   - `users`
   - `orders`
   - `order_items`
   - `inquiries`

The SQL file creates the database structure and inserts the initial categories and products.

### 4. Check the Database Configuration

The default settings in `db.php` are:

```php
$databaseHost = "localhost";
$databaseUsername = "root";
$databasePassword = "";
$databaseName = "yeast_lab_db";
```

Update these values only if the local MySQL configuration is different.

### 5. Run the Website

Open this address in a browser:

```text
http://localhost/The_Yeast_Lab/
```

Alternatively, open the homepage directly:

```text
http://localhost/The_Yeast_Lab/index.php
```

## Creating a Customer Account

1. Open `http://localhost/The_Yeast_Lab/register.php`.
2. Enter a full name, email address, phone number, and password.
3. Submit the registration form.
4. Log in using the newly created account.

Customer accounts can access the shopping cart, checkout, profile management, and order history.

## Creating an Administrator Account

For security, the project does not include a default plain-text administrator password.

1. Register a new account through `register.php`, for example `admin@theyeastlab.com`.
2. Open phpMyAdmin.
3. Select the `yeast_lab_db` database.
4. Open the **SQL** tab.
5. Run the following query, replacing the email if necessary:

```sql
UPDATE users
SET user_role = 'Admin'
WHERE email = 'admin@theyeastlab.com';
```

6. Log out from the website if the account is currently logged in.
7. Log in again so the new administrator role is stored in the PHP session.

The administrator dashboard is available at:

```text
http://localhost/The_Yeast_Lab/admin/dashboard.php
```

## Demo Administrator Account

- Email: `admin@theyeastlab.com`
- Password: `admin123`

Administrator dashboard:

`http://localhost/The_Yeast_Lab/admin/dashboard.php`

This account is provided only for local assignment demonstration purposes.

## Product Image Management

Product image files are stored in the `includes` folder. When adding or editing a product in the administrator area, enter the exact image filename, including its extension.

Example:

```text
strawberrydanish.jpeg
```

The image must already exist inside:

```text
The_Yeast_Lab/includes/
```

## Suggested Functional Test

Perform the following test after installation:

1. Register a customer account.
2. Log in as the customer.
3. Browse, search, filter, and sort products.
4. Open a product details page.
5. Add products to the cart.
6. Increase and decrease product quantities.
7. Complete one pickup order.
8. Complete one delivery order.
9. View the orders from the customer profile.
10. Submit a contact inquiry.
11. Log out and log in using an administrator account.
12. Add, edit, deactivate, and delete a temporary product.
13. Update an order and payment status.
14. Update and delete a temporary inquiry.
15. Test the layout on desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

## Security and Validation

The project implements:

- Prepared SQL statements
- Password hashing with `password_hash()`
- Password verification with `password_verify()`
- Session regeneration after login
- Customer and administrator role checks
- Server-side form validation
- Output escaping with `htmlspecialchars()`
- Stock validation during cart and checkout operations
- MySQL transactions for order creation and stock updates
- Order ownership checks

## Troubleshooting

### WampServer Icon Is Not Green

Confirm that Apache and MySQL are running. Check whether another application is using Apache or MySQL ports.

### Database Connection Failed

Confirm that MySQL is running and verify the username, password, and database name in `db.php`.

### CSS Changes Do Not Appear

Save `style.css`, then perform a hard refresh using `Ctrl + F5`.

### Product Image Does Not Appear

Confirm that the image filename stored in MySQL exactly matches the filename inside the `includes` folder.

### Administrator Access Is Denied

Confirm that the account has `user_role = 'Admin'` in the `users` table. Log out and log in again after changing the role.
